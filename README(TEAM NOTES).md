UCB Code Boot Camp - FINAL PROJECT

Slack Channel:  #SparklePonies 

Project Name: “Heddit”

Project Overview: 

	We love reddit. The world loves reddit. In the US it’s the 3rd most visited site 	and 6th most visited in the world. But.. our bosses, uh they don’t always love 	that we love reddit so much so... we created Heddit. Just for you, so you can 	read what you want while staying productive at work. With our app you can 	hide what you’re researching while disguising it in your desktop as a 	productivity tool. Give it a try! 

	Btw.. did you know recent work productivity studies have shown that allowing 	employees privileges to certain social apps (like reddit) at work actually helps 	with productivity giving employees a way to stay connected and informed, 	thus increasing happiness and as a result increased productivity!

Team Mates & Roles & Tasks: 
	Haley - Project/Product Manager 
	Kat - Creative Director 
	Jesse - UX/UI Front End Developer
	Bex - Back End Developer 

Screen-by-Screen - WIREFRAME
	we need a detailed set of screen-by-screen design layouts with 	annotations describing all UI/UX components & all data relevant to the 	screen
